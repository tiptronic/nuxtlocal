I now added the Eufy S340 to both, HomeKit (via <https://homebridge.io>) AND the Eufy.app at the same time (that's what I originally wanted). It's unfortunate that we need an external solution to do this, but anyway, now it works fine and I can even decide where I want notifications to come from (Eufy.app and/or HomeKit).

Preview-Videos in HomeKit are good enough for a quick peek - if I want even more detail I still can use the Eufy.app.

AND - now the S340 nicely integrates with my other notifications/automations in HomeKit.

And there's one more benefit (for me): I have 1 or 2 blind spots in the garden (where I currently use a E220 (indoor) since 2 years, which is good during the day, but has its issues in the night). I'm curious how the S340 performs out there ( I'm going to install it there once the weather gets better :))

Comparing the raw video data turns out, the S340 is significantly better than the E220 (especially in night mode), but the E220 is still awesome (during daytime and if you compare prices - where the E220 costs a fraction of the S340)

I'm still curious how the S3Pro compares (I ordered some and we'll see).
